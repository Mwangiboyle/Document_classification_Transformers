Fine-Tuning BERT for Document Classification
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the steps involved in fine-tuning a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for document classification tasks. BERT is a pre-trained transformer model that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks.
Overview
The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for the task of document classification. The notebook covers the following steps:

1.Loading and preparing the dataset.
2.Preprocessing the text data.
3.Tokenizing the text using BERT tokenizer.
4.Creating data loaders for training and validation.
5.Fine-tuning the BERT model.
6.Evaluating the model's performance on the validation set.
7.Making predictions on new data.
